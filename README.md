Creative Embedded Systems Module 1â€”Generative Art

Jasveenkaur Wahan

# About
This module is for generative art inspired by falling leaves. Using triangles to represent leaves, they fall from the top to the bottom of an ESP32 TTGO T-display with slightly variable speeds and directions. They change colors based on where they are on screen, and regenerate at the top of the screen upon reaching the bottom. More information about the art and design process can be found at https://momentous-capri-780.notion.site/Fall-114cfd6ea3d780048c88e4dfb3ff006f.
